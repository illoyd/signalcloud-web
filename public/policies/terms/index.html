        <p>Effective 1 August 2013</p>
        
        <p>This License Agreement for SignalCloud (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) is made and entered into by and between SignalCloud and the business entity agreeing to these terms (&#8220;Customer&#8221;). &#8220;SignalCloud&#8221; means SignalCloud, llc. with offices at {INCORPORATION ADDRESS}. This Agreement is effective as of the date Customer clicks the &#8220;I Accept&#8221; button below (the &#8220;Effective Date&#8221;). If you are accepting on behalf of Customer, you represent and warrant that: (i) if you have full legal authority to bind Customer to this Agreement; (ii) you have read and understand this Agreement; and (iii) you agree, on behalf of Customer, to this Agreement. If you do not have the legal authority to bind Customer, please do not click the &#8220;I Accept&#8221; button below. This Agreement governs Customer&#8217;s access to and use of the Service.</p>
        
        <h3 id='1_licenses'>1. Licenses.</h3>
        
        <p><strong>1.1 From SignalCloud to Customer.</strong> Subject to this Agreement, SignalCloud grants to Customer a worldwide, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, terminable, limited license to (a) use the Service, (b) integrate the Service into any Application and provide the Service, solely as integrated into the Application, to users of the Application and (c) use any Software provided by SignalCloud as part of the Service.</p>
        
        <p><strong>1.2 From Customer to SignalCloud.</strong> By submitting, posting, generating or displaying any Application and/or Customer Data on or through the Service, Customer gives SignalCloud a worldwide, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, terminable, limited license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute any Application and/or including Customer Data for the sole purpose of enabling SignalCloud to provide Customer with the Service in accordance with the Agreement.</p>
        
        <h3 id='2_provision_of_the_service'>2. Provision of the Service.</h3>
        
        <p><strong>2.1 Console.</strong> SignalCloud will provide the Service to Customer. As part of receiving the Service, Customer will have access to the Admin Console, through which Customer may administer the Service.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2.2 Facilities and Data Transfer.</strong> All facilities used to store and process an Application and Customer Data will adhere to reasonable security standards no less protective than the security standards at facilities where SignalCloud processes and stores its own information of a similar type. SignalCloud has implemented at least industry standard systems and procedures to ensure the security and confidentiality of an Application and Customer Data, protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of an Application and Customer Data, and protect against unauthorized access to or use of an Application and Customer Data. SignalCloud may process and store an Application and Customer Data in the United States or any other country in which SignalCloud or its agents maintain facilities. By using the Service, Customer consents to this processing and storage of an Application and Customer Data. The parties agree that SignalCloud is merely a data processor.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2.3 Data Storage Selection.</strong></p>
        
        <p><em>a. Data Storage.</em> At this time all End User Data will be stored permanently, at rest, in the United States. SignalCloud and its agents are currently not European Union Safe Harbour certified.</p>
        
        <p><em>b. Transient Storage.</em> End User Data may be stored transiently or cached in any country in which SignalCloud or its agents maintain facilities before reaching permanent storage.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2.4 Accounts.</strong> Customer must have an Account to use the Service, and is responsible for the information it provides to create the Account, the security of its passwords for the Account, and for any use of its Account. If Customer becomes aware of any unauthorized use of its password or its Account, Customer will notify SignalCloud as promptly as possible.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2.5 Privacy Policies.</strong> The Service is subject to SignalCloud&#8217;s Privacy Policy. Changes to the Privacy Policy will be made as stated in the applicable policy. SignalCloud and its agents are not enrolled in the Safe Harbor programme at this time.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2.6 New Applications.</strong> SignalCloud may make new applications, tools, features or functionality available from time to time through the Service, the use of which may be contingent upon Customer&#8217;s agreement to additional terms.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2.7 Modifications.</strong></p>
        
        <p><em>a. To the Service.</em> Subject to Section 9.4 (Termination for Convenience), SignalCloud may make commercially reasonable Updates to the Service from time to time. If SignalCloud makes a material change to the Service, SignalCloud will inform Customer, provided that Customer has subscribed with SignalCloud to be informed about such change.</p>
        
        <p><em>b. To the Agreement.</em> SignalCloud may make changes to this Agreement, including pricing from time to time. Unless otherwise noted by SignalCloud, material changes to the Agreement will become effective 90 days after they are posted, except if the changes apply to new functionality in which case they will be effective immediately. If Customer does not agree to the revised Agreement, please stop using the Service. SignalCloud will post any modification to this Agreement to the Terms URL.</p>
        
        <h3 id='3_payment_terms'>3. Payment Terms.</h3>
        
        <p><strong>3.1 Free Quota.</strong> From time to time SignalCloud may provide free or trial periods to Customer without charge up to the Fee Threshold.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3.2 Online Billing.</strong> SignalCloud will issue an electronic bill to Customer for all charges accrued above any applicable Fee Threshold. Fees are solely based on SignalCloud&#8217;s measurements of Customer&#8217;s use of the Service, may include monthly fees, and SignalCloud&#8217;s determination is final. For use above the Fee Threshold, Customer shall be responsible for all Fees up to the amount set in the Account and shall pay all Fees in U.S. Dollars or in such other currency as agreed to in writing by the parties. Customer shall pay all Fees in accordance with the payment terms in the Service FAQ.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3.3 Delinquent Payments.</strong> Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). SignalCloud reserves the right to suspend Customer&#8217;s Account for any late payments.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3.4 Taxes.</strong> Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and Customer will pay SignalCloud for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If SignalCloud is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to Customer, unless Customer provides SignalCloud with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. In some states the sales tax is due on the total purchase price at the time of sale and must be invoiced and collected at the time of the sale. If Customer is required by law to withhold any Taxes from its payments to SignalCloud, Customer must provide SignalCloud with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such withholding payments.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3.5 Invoice Disputes &amp; Refunds.</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by law, Customer waives all claims relating to Fees unless claimed within sixty days after charged (this does not affect any Customer rights with its credit card issuer). Refunds (if any) are at the discretion of SignalCloud and will only be in the form of credit for the Service. Nothing in this Agreement obligates SignalCloud to extend credit to any party.</p>
        
        <h3 id='4_customer_obligations'>4. Customer Obligations.</h3>
        
        <p><strong>4.1 Compliance.</strong> Customer is solely responsible for its Applications and Customer Data, and for making sure its Applications or Customer Data comply with the Acceptable Use Policy. SignalCloud reserves the right to review the Application or Customer Data to ensure Customer&#8217;s compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy. Customer is responsible for ensuring all End Users comply with Customer&#8217;s obligations under the Agreement.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4.2 Privacy.</strong> Customer will protect the privacy and legal rights of its End Users under all applicable laws and regulations, which includes a legally adequate privacy notice communicated from Customer. Customer may have the ability to access, monitor, use, or disclose Customer Data submitted by End Users through the Service. Customer will obtain and maintain any required consents from End Users to allow Customer&#8217;s access, monitoring, use and disclosure of Customer Data. Further, Customer will notify its End Users that any Customer Data provided as part of the Service will be made available to a third party as part of SignalCloud providing the Service.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4.3 Restrictions.</strong> Customer will not, and will not allow third parties under its control to: (a) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile, translate, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the Service or any component thereof (subject to Section 4.4 below); (b) use the Service for High Risk Activities; (c) sublicense, resell, or distribute the Service or any component thereof separate from any integrated Application; (d) use the Service to create, train, or improve (directly or indirectly) a substantially similar product or service, including any other machine translation engine; (e) create multiple Applications or Accounts to simulate or act as a single Application or Account (respectively) or otherwise access the Service in a manner intended to avoid incurring Fees; or (f) process or store any Customer Data that is subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the United States Department of State. Customer acknowledges that the Service is not HIPAA compliant and Customer is solely responsible for any applicable compliance with HIPAA.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4.4 Open Source Components.</strong> Open source software licenses for components of the Service released under an open source license constitute separate written agreements. Open source software is listed in the Documentation. To the limited extent the open source software licenses expressly supersede this Agreement, the open source license instead governs Customer&#8217;s agreement with SignalCloud for the specific included open source components of the Service, or use of the Service (as may be applicable).</p>
        
        <p><strong>4.5 Documentation.</strong> SignalCloud may provide Documentation for Customer&#8217;s use of the Service. The Documentation may specify restrictions (e.g. attribution of HTML restrictions) on how the Applications may be built or the Service may be used and Customer agrees to comply with any such restrictions specified.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4.6 DMCA Policy.</strong> SignalCloud provides information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online, but SignalCloud cannot determine whether something is being used legally or not without their input. SignalCloud responds to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminates accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If Customer thinks somebody is violating Customer&#8217;s or its End Users&#8217; copyrights and wants to notify SignalCloud, Customer can find information about submitting notices, and SignalCloud&#8217;s policy about responding to notices at <a href='/policies/dmca.html'>http://signalcloudapp.com/policies/dmca.html</a>.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4.7 Application and No Multiple Accounts, Bills.</strong> Any Application must have material value independent from the Services. SignalCloud has no obligation to provide multiple bills or Accounts to Customer under the Agreement.</p>
        
        <h3 id='5_suspension_and_removals'>5. Suspension and Removals.</h3>
        
        <p><strong>5.1 Suspension/Removals.</strong> If Customer becomes aware that any Application or an End User&#8217;s use of an Application, or Customer Data violates the Acceptable Use Policy, Customer will immediately suspend the Application, remove the applicable Customer Data, or suspend access to an End User (as may be applicable). If Customer fails to suspend or remove as noted in the prior sentence, SignalCloud may specifically request that Customer do so. If Customer fails to comply with SignalCloud&#8217;s request to do so within twenty-four hours, then SignalCloud may suspend SignalCloud accounts of the applicable End Users, disable the Application, and/or disable the Account (as may be applicable) until such violation is corrected.</p>
        
        <p><strong>5.2 Emergency Security Issues.</strong> Despite the foregoing, if there is an Emergency Security Issue, then SignalCloud may automatically suspend the offending End User account, Application or the Account. Suspension will be to the minimum extent required, and of the minimum duration, to prevent or terminate the Emergency Security Issue. If SignalCloud suspends an End User account or the Application or Account, for any reason, without prior notice to Customer, at Customer&#8217;s request, SignalCloud will provide Customer the reason for the suspension as soon as is reasonably possible.</p>
        
        <h3 id='6_intellectual_property_rights_brand_features'>6. Intellectual Property Rights; Brand Features.</h3>
        
        <p><strong>6.1 Intellectual Property Rights.</strong> Except as expressly set forth herein, this Agreement does not grant either party any rights, implied or otherwise, to the other&#8217;s content or any of the other&#8217;s intellectual property. As between the parties, Customer owns all Intellectual Property Rights in any Application and Customer Data, and SignalCloud owns all Intellectual Property Rights in the Service.</p>
        
        <p><strong>6.2 Brand Features Limitation.</strong> If Customer wants to display SignalCloud Brand Features in connection with its use of the Service, Customer must obtain written permission from SignalCloud through the process specified in the Trademark Guidelines. For the sole purpose of providing the Service, Customer permits SignalCloud to display any Brand Features that may appear in its Application. Any use of a party&#8217;s Brand Features will inure to the benefit of the party holding Intellectual Property Rights to those Brand Features. A party may revoke the other party&#8217;s right to use its Brand Features pursuant to this Agreement with written notice to the other and a reasonable period to stop the use.</p>
        
        <h3 id='7_technical_support_service'>7. Technical Support Service.</h3>
        
        <p><strong>7.1 By Customer.</strong> Customer is responsible for technical support of its Application.</p>
        
        <p><strong>7.2 By SignalCloud.</strong> Subject to payment of applicable TSS Fees, SignalCloud will provide TSS to Customer during the term of the Agreement in accordance with the TSS Guidelines. Certain TSS levels include a minimum recurring Fee as described in the &#8220;Fees&#8221; url(s) noted below. If Customer downgrades its TSS level during any calendar month, SignalCloud may continue to provide TSS at the same level and TSS Fees before the downgrade for the remainder of that month.</p>
        
        <p><strong>7.3 Deprecation Policy.</strong></p>
        
        <p>SignalCloud will announce if we intend to discontinue or make backwards incompatible changes to this API or Service. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to operate that Service without these changes until the later of: (i) one year after the announcement or (ii) April 20, 2015, unless (as SignalCloud determines in its reasonable good faith judgment):</p>
        
        <p>required by law or third party relationship (including if there is a change in applicable law or relationship), or doing so could create a security risk or substantial economic or material technical burden (the above policy, the &#8220;Deprecation Policy&#8221;). This Deprecation Policy doesn&#8217;t apply to versions, features, and functionality labeled as &#8220;experimental.&#8221;</p>
        
        <h3 id='8_confidential_information'>8. Confidential Information.</h3>
        
        <p><strong>8.1 Obligations.</strong> The recipient of the other party&#8217;s Confidential Information will not disclose the Confidential Information, except to Affiliates, employees, agents, or professional advisors who need to know it and who have agreed in writing (or in the case of professional advisors are otherwise bound) to keep it confidential. The recipient will ensure that those people and entities use the Confidential Information only to exercise rights and fulfill obligations under this Agreement, while using reasonable care to keep it confidential. The recipient may also disclose Confidential Information when required by law after giving reasonable notice to the discloser if allowed by law. The recipient may also disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable Legal Process; provided that the recipient uses commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) promptly notify the other party of such disclosure before disclosing; and (ii) comply with the other party&#8217;s reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose the disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subsections (i) and (ii) above will not apply if the recipient determines that complying with (i) and (ii) could: (a) result in a violation of Legal Process; (b) obstruct a governmental investigation; and/or (c) lead to death or serious physical harm to an individual. As between the parties, Customer is responsible for responding to all third party requests concerning its use and its End Users&#8217; use of the Services.</p>
        
        <h3 id='9_term_and_termination'>9. Term and Termination.</h3>
        
        <p><strong>9.1 Agreement Term.</strong> The license granted in this Agreement will remain in effect, unless terminated earlier as set forth in this Agreement.</p>
        
        <p><strong>9.2 Termination for Breach.</strong> Either party may terminate this Agreement for breach if: (i) the other party is in material breach of the Agreement and fails to cure that breach within thirty days after receipt of written notice; (ii) the other party ceases its business operations or becomes subject to insolvency proceedings and the proceedings are not dismissed within ninety days; or (iii) the other party is in material breach of this Agreement more than two times notwithstanding any cure of such breaches.</p>

        <p><strong>9.4 Termination for Convenience.</strong> Customer may stop using the Service at any time.

        <p><strong>14.1 By Customer.</strong> Customer will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless SignalCloud from and against all liabilities, damages, and costs (including settlement costs and reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees) arising out of a third party claim: (i) regarding any Application or Customer Data; (ii) that Customer Brand Features infringe or misappropriate any patent, copyright, trade secret or trademark of a third party; or (iii) regarding Customer&#8217;s, or its End Users&#8217;, use of the Service in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy.</p>
        
        <p><strong>14.2 By SignalCloud.</strong> SignalCloud will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Customer from and against all liabilities, damages, and costs (including settlement costs and reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees) arising out of a third party claim that SignalCloud&#8217;s technology used to provide the Service (excluding any open source software) or any SignalCloud Brand Feature infringes or misappropriates any patent, copyright, trade secret or trademark of such third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall SignalCloud have any obligations or liability under this Section arising from: (i) use of any Service or SignalCloud Brand Features in a modified form or in combination with materials not furnished by SignalCloud, and (ii) any Customer Data.</p>
        
        <p><strong>14.3 Possible Infringement.</strong></p>
        
        <p><em>a. Repair, Replace, or Modify.</em> If SignalCloud reasonably believes the Service infringes a third party&#8217;s Intellectual Property Rights, then SignalCloud will: (a) obtain the right for Customer, at SignalCloud&#8217;s expense, to continue using the Service; (b) provide a non-infringing functionally equivalent replacement; or (c) modify the Service so that it no longer infringes.</p>
        
        <p><em>b. Suspension or Termination.</em> If SignalCloud does not believe the foregoing options are commercially reasonable, then SignalCloud may suspend or terminate Customer&#8217;s use of the impacted Service.</p>
        
        <p><strong>14.4 General.</strong> As a condition to indemnification for a claim, the party seeking indemnification must promptly notify the other party of the claim in writing and cooperate with the other party in defending the claim. The indemnifying party has full control and authority over the defense, except that: (a) any settlement requiring the party seeking indemnification to admit liability or to pay any money will require that party&#8217;s prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and (b) the other party may join in the defense with its own counsel at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the indemnified party settles without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party has no obligation of contribution. THE INDEMNITIES ABOVE ARE THE ONLY REMEDY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR VIOLATION OF A THIRD PARTY&#8217;S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</p>
